	<h1>My Experience</h1>
	 <p> The overall experience and mood of the place was much more lax than usual. Sure they had meetings and stuff going on. I learned that people may have different areas they specialize in while working on projects. This includes those that focus more on html or rather on design itself.
	 </p>
	 <h2>Chillness</h2>
	 <p> After seeing how chill a workspace can be I actually wanted to find out more about how I could be able to work at a place like this. To pretty much be able to come into work at your own pace. Thats something I would want in any future job experience </p>
	 <h3>Favorita</h3>
	 <p> My favorite part of the trip was walking inside from the cold air. I almost cried tears of joy because that jacket I had on was obviously not helping. In all seriousness though I loved seeing their work when we talked about the farming tool. That was actually really cool and I wanted to see it.</p>
